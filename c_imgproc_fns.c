//! Transform the input image by swapping the row and column
//! of each source pixel when copying it to the output image.
//! E.g., a pixel at row i and column j of the input image
//! should be copied to row j and column i of the output image.
//! Note that this transformation can only be applied to square
//! images (where the width and height are identical.)

//! Transform the input image by copying only those pixels that are
//! within an ellipse centered within the bounds of the image.
//! Pixels not in the ellipse should be left unmodified, which will
//! make them opaque black.
//!
//! Let w represent the width of the image and h represent the
//! height of the image. Let a=floor(w/2) and b=floor(h/2).
//! Consider the pixel at row b and column a is being at the
//! center of the image. When considering whether a specific pixel
//! is in the ellipse, x is the horizontal distance to the center
//! of the image and y is the vertical distance to the center of
//! the image. The pixel at the coordinates described by x and y
//! is in the ellipse if the following inequality is true:
//!
//!   floor( (10000*x*x) / (a*a) ) + floor( (10000*y*y) / (b*b) ) <= 10000

//! Transform the input image using an "emboss" effect. The pixels
//! of the source image are transformed as follows.
//!
//! The top row and left column of pixels are transformed so that their
//! red, green, and blue color component values are all set to 128,
//! and their alpha values are not modified.
//!
//! For all other pixels, we consider the pixel's color component
//! values r, g, and b, and also the pixel's upper-left neighbor's
//! color component values nr, ng, and nb. In comparing the color
//! component values of the pixel and its upper-left neighbor,
//! we consider the differences (nr-r), (ng-g), and (nb-b).
//! Whichever of these differences has the largest absolute value
//! we refer to as diff. (Note that in the case that more than one
//! difference has the same absolute value, the red difference has
//! priority over green and blue, and the green difference has priority
//! over blue.)
//!
//! From the value diff, compute the value gray as 128 + diff.
//! However, gray should be clamped so that it is in the range
//! 0..255. I.e., if it's negative, it should become 0, and if
//! it is greater than 255, it should become 255.
//!
//! For all pixels not in the top or left row, the pixel's red, green,
//! and blue color component values should be set to gray, and the
//! alpha value should be left unmodified.

//! @param output_img pointer to the output Image (in which the
//!                   transformed pixels should be stored)
